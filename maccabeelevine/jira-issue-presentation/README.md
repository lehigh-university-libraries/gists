For when you are screen-sharing Jira issues on a projected screen, and you want to zoom in 150% so people in the room can actually see the issue content.  Normally all the zoomed-in headers and sidebars crowd out the actual issue content.

This hides all headers and the left sidebar, and scales the right sidebar back down to normal size (assuming the 150% screen zoom).
